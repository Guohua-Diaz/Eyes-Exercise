# Eyes-Exercise

## Two eyes movement
```What should you expect on this game?  The two eyes would follow your mouse movement accordingly.```

## How to run 
*Once you have all the files downloaded, move your mouse as desired.*

## Roadmap of future improvements
> I would change different background colors and eye-shapes once get comfortable editting css files.
